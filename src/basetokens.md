### Choose the Base Token thatâ€™s right for you.
Every base token ensures high liquidity besides offering some advantages. The choice depends on whether creator expects stablitiy of pricing relative to US Dollar or whether the creator wants the upside of creator's tokens getting traded against well established cryptocurrencies. New Base Tokens maybe added over time. We only prefer ERC20 or equivalent tokens (like BEP20).
