We plan to target low gas fee EVM compatible chains first since the same smart contracts will work it is just a matter of deployment and updating the webapp.

Currently, each network will be exclusive of others. Creator can be on multiple networks but there will be no cross network integration.

We don't have any personal preference but Creators are advised to choose networks with high transaction volumes and low gas fees first.  

### Round 1 (4 months):

- [ ] First we will deploy to 6 netowrk's testnet for 1-2 month, meanwhile onboarding creators and building community, 

- [ ] and then to mainnet.

Top EVM compatible chains:
1. Avalanche 
2. Polygon
3. BSC 
4. Fantom  
5. Harmony 
6. Moonriver, Moonbeam (Polkadot Parachains)

### Round 2 (1 months): 

- Due to high number of transactions and low average transaction value, we believe Ethereum is not the best for our protocol but still this step will help get high end Ethereum network users.

- Also profits generated from Round 1 will help pay gas fee for contract deployment.

7. Ethereum

### Round 3 (2 months):

Remaining EVM compatible chains:

Top EVM compatible chains:
8. Arbitrum 
9. Optimism 
10. xDai
11. OKEx 
12. HECO
13. Solana (Using Solang Compiler or maybe Neon)

### Round 4 (5 months):
   
We further plan to expand to EVM non-compatible networks depending on user demand:

13. Solana 
14. Terra 
15. Algorand 
16. Cardano
